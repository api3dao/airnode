/// is entirely optional. However, if you are not storing your templates or
/// subscriptions on-chain, you should make sure that the respective Airnode
/// already knows about them (e.g., their details are hardcoded in the
/// Airnode configuration file).
/// @dev Templates and subscriptions need to persist, which is why we do not
/// depend on storing them in logs and the respective Airnode being able to
/// retrieve them from there. Compared to that, storage is a much safer bet.
/// However, this may end up being prohibitively expensive on some chains, in
/// which case the user should consider off-chain channels to pass the details.
