# @airnode/node

> The node part of Airnode that allows for connecting multiple blockchains to the rest of the world

## Features

- Earn money by exposing your API to the rapidly growing blockchain dApp market
- Listen for on-chain events and respond with off-chain data
- Requesters pay all transaction costs
- Simple installation and limited to no day-to-day maintenance
- Serverless allows for paying as you use and limitless scalability

## Installation

**Important: Airnode is in active development and likely to change before the stable release**

Airnode has not yet been published, so you will need to clone and install the entire repository. This can be done by running:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:api3dao/airnode.git

# Run from the repository root
npm run bootstrap
```

## Configuration

Before running Airnode, you will need to have a valid `config.json` and `security.json` placed in the packages/node folder. You can find more information on these files in the API3 documentation [repository](https://github.com/api3dao/api3-docs).

## Usage

Airnode does not yet have an stable API for usage. However, you can run for development and testing by running the following from the repository root:

```sh
# Run Airnode once using the AWS serverless handler
npm run invoke:aws

# Expose a local endpoint at localhost:3000 where you can initiate actions by sending HTTP requests
npm run dev:aws
```

## Behaviour

This is a running list of how different errors are handled by the node and test tracking. It is likely to change in the future.
