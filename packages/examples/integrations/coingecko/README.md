# Coingecko example integration

This is the most basic example showcasing `config.json` and `secrets.env` (which is automatically generated for you with
one of our scripts).

The `config.json` defines a single callable endpoint, called `coinMarketData` which you can call to determine the
current price of some crypto currency. The example request uses this endpoint to retrieve the current price of Ethereum.
