# Coingecko example integration

This is the most basic example showcasing `config.json` and `secrets.env` (which is automatically generated for you as part of the deployment flow).

The `config.json` defines a single callable endpoint, called `coinMarketData` which you can call to determine the current price of some crypto currency.
