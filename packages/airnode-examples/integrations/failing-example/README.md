# Failing example integration

This is a very basic example showcasing `config.json` and `secrets.env` (which is automatically generated for you with
one of our scripts). Although most of the data is same as in the Coingecko example, the endpoint URL is intentionally
invalid, causing the request to fail everytime one tries to make it. This is to show what the behaviour of Airnode is
like in case of failure.

For more information about how the Airnode is configured, refer to the
[docs](https://docs.api3.org/airnode/latest/grp-providers/guides/build-an-airnode/configuring-airnode.html).
