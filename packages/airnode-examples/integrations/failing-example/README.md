# Failing example integration

This integration is similar to the coingecko integration, but the endpoint URL is intentionally invalid. This causes
requests to fail and therefore serves to demonstrate Airnode behaviour in the case of failure.

For more information about how the Airnode is configured, refer to the
[docs](https://docs.api3.org/reference/airnode/latest/understand/configuring.html).
